### Epigram on Failure
Given the following quote by Alan Perlis

*“Dealing with failure is easy: Work hard to improve. Success is also easy to
handle: You’ve solved the wrong problem. Work hard to improve.”*

Considering only the alphabetical characters, consonants having the value of
their ASCII codes, and vowels having the inverse value of their ASCII codes,
what is the sum of the sentence?

Example:
Taking the word *“iffy”*, the ASCII code of *“i”* is 105, it’s inverse is -105.
The ASCII value of *‘f’* is 102. The ASCII y of *“y”* is 121. The sum of *“iffy”* = 220

### Fibonacci
The Fibonacci sequence begins like this:
0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34 (each number is the sum of the previous two)

What is the sum of all odd numbers in the Fibonacci sequence that are less 
than 10,000?

### Legionaries
In the range 1 - 13 (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13) the digit 1
occurs 6 times.

In the range, 1 - 2,660 (half the number of Romans in a legion), expressed in
Roman numerals, how many times does the numeral “X” occur?

### Palindromes
A palindrome is a word, number, phrase, or another sequence of characters which
reads the same backward as forward, such as madam, racecar, or the number 10801

What is the sum of all numeric palindromes that are less than 10,000?
